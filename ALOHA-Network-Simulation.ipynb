    "The following code implements the simulation of a 2-node ALOHA network. It is based on a problem posed in Dr. Norman Matloff's open textbook *From Algorithms to Z-Scores: Probabilistic and Statistical Modeling in Computer Science*, which can be downloaded from [here](http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/probstatbook). \n",
    "\n",
    "The salient features of the network are follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The nodes share a common channel for sending messages\n",
    "* Only one message can be sent through various time segments known as epochs, denoted by $k=0, 1, 2, 3 \\ldots n$\n",
    "* Only one node can send a message through the channel at the end of an epoch. If both nodes try to send a message at the same time, collision occurs and no message gets sent\n",
    "* A node is said to be active if it has a message to send\n",
    "* At epoch $k = 0$, both nodes have messages to send. Hence, both nodes start out active\n",
    "* X is a random variable that holds the total number of active nodes at the end of epoch $k$. Hence, $X_k = 2$ for $k=0$\n",
    "* Each node sends a message with probability $p=0.4$ if there is a message to send\n",
    "* If a node does not have a message to send, it generates a new message in the middle of an epoch with probability $q=0.8 \n",
